This project implements the stack data structure, using link list, and the
basic operations like push, pop, read and print, that can be done on it.
Furthermore when the program is executing builds the stack from the file
StackFile.txt, if it exists,  and before its termination stores stack's data 
in the file StackFile.txt, if it exists, otherwise it creates it.
